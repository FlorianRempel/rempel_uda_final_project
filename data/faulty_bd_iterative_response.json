    "9.2.": "Answer: \n\nParagraph 15 of DORA is most closely related to the BAIT article 9.2. This paragraph states that financial entities shall perform a risk assessment upon each major change in the network and information system infrastr ucture, in the processes or procedures affecting their ICT supported business functions, information assets or ICT assets. The paragraph also mentions that financial entities shall identify all information assets and ICT assets, including those on remote sites, network resources and hardware equipment, and shall map those considered critical. This aligns with the requirement in the BAIT article 9.2 for a risk assessment to be performed prior to each instance of external procurement of IT services, and for the institution to be flexible in defining the nature and scope of the risk assessment, taking account of proportionality aspects. The paragraph also mentions the involvement of the functions responsible for information security and business continuity management, which is also required in the BAIT article 9.2.",

    "12.1.": "  Answer: \n  The paragraph that is most closely related to the BAIT article is paragraph 12.1. This paragraph adds requirements for the effective implementation of special measures to achieve the critical infrastructure protection (CIP) objective to the Supervisory Requirements for IT in Financial Institutions. The CIP objective is defined as maintaining the society\u2019s security of supply for critical services, such as cash supply, card-based payment transactions, conventional payment transactions, and the clearing and settlement of securities and derivatives transactions. CI operators and their IT service providers are required to describe and effectively implement appropriate measures for critical services to reduce the risks to the secure operation of critical infrastructure to a level appropriate for the CIP objective. They must align themselves with relevant standards and consider high availability concepts, and use state-of-the-art technology. Companies can choose to use this chapter to provide verification under section 8a (3) of the Act on the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI Act) within the context of an audit of the annual financial statements, which requires that all information technology systems, components, and processes that are part of the critical infrastructure are covered by the audit in full. Alternatively, CI operators can adopt a company-specific approach or create an industry-specific security standard under section 8a (2) of the BSI Act.",
    "12.2.": "  Answer: \nParagraph 17 of DORA is most closely related to the BAIT article 12.2. \n\n  Explanation: \nParagraph 17 of DORA outlines the requirements for an ICT-related incident management process, which includes the need to tag all relevant interfaces and components of critical infrastructure within the information domain. This is similar to the requirement in the BAIT article 12.2 to tag all relevant components and areas of the critical service in a clear and comprehensible manner. Additionally, paragraph 17 of DORA requires that all relevant BAIT requirements and other supervisory requirements be applied to all components and areas of the critical service, which is similar to the requirement in the BAIT article 12.2 to apply all relevant BAIT requirements and other supervisory requirements to all components and areas of the critical service. Finally, paragraph 17 of DORA requires that critical services be monitored appropriately and the potential impact of security incidents on critical services be assessed, which is similar to the requirement in the BAIT article 12.2 to monitor critical services appropriately and assess the potential impact of security incidents on critical services.",
    "12.3.": "  Answer: \n\n  The paragraph from DORA that is most closely related to the BAIT article 12.3 is paragraph 1, second subparagraph, point (a), which states that the ICT risk management framework shall be implemented, as appropriate, and shall include operational conclusions resulting from the tests referred to in point (g) and from post-incident analysis into the ICT risk assessment process and shall develop, according to needs and ICT risk profile, ICT security awareness programmes and digital operational resilience training for staff and management. This paragraph emphasizes the importance of implementing appropriate measures to mitigate risks and ensure the achievement of the CIP objective, particularly for critical services. It also highlights the need to maintain state-of-the-art technology and take appropriate precautions to mitigate risks, while ensuring supply security and not just on the basis of economic considerations.",
    "12.4.": "  Answer: \nThe paragraph most closely related to the BAIT article 12.4 is paragraph 6 of Article 11 of DORA. This paragraph states that financial entities shall implement ICT business continuity policy and disaster recovery plans through appropriate and documentable arrangements, plans, procedures and mechanisms aiming to ensure the continuity of critical or important functions, quickly and effectively respond to and resolve ICT-related incidents, activate, without delay, dedicated plans that enable containment measures, processes and technologies suited to each type of ICT-related incident and prevent further damage, estimate preliminary impacts, damages and losses, set out communication and crisis management actions that ensure that updat ed information is transmitted to all relevant internal and external stakeholders in accordance with Article 14, and report to the competent authorities in accordance with Article 19. This paragraph also states that financial entities shall put in place, maintain and periodically test appropriate ICT business continuity plans, notably with regard to critical or important functions outsourced or contracted through arrangements with ICT third-party service providers. This paragraph takes into account the CIP objective and the emergency preparedness planning requirements mentioned in the BAIT article 12.4.",
    "12.5.": "  Answer: \n\n  The paragraph from DORA that is most closely related to the BAIT article is paragraph 12.5. This paragraph discusses the verification under section 8a (3) of the BSI Act regarding compliance with the requirements under section 8a (1) of the BSI Act, which can be conducted as part of the audit of the annual financial statements. The paragraph also mentions that CI operators should submit the relevant verification documents to the BSI on time and in accordance with the relevant requirements of the BSI. Additionally, the paragraph notes that there are other permissible ways to provide verification aside from the audit as part of the annual financial statements, and provides a reference to the current version of the \u201cOrientation Guide to Verification According to \u00a7 8a (3) BSI Act\u201d."
