# UDA_FinalProject_Rempel

This project has been setup such that utilizing Google Colab is the preffered way of running it's code

## Instructions:

1. Open the mistral_analysis.ipynb in a Google Colab environment
2. Upload the two documents 'dora.pdf' and 'BAIT_en.pdf' from the 'data' folder into the main directory of the Google Colab envirionment
3. Then execute the notebooks cell by cell. 

## Note: 

While it may be possible to execute the notebook locally, resolving all necessary dependencies may prove challenging and the use of Google Colab is therefore strongly suggested.

The uda_final_project_analysis.ipynb notebook should be run locally as it expects to directly access the data-directory.
